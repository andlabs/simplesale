requirements:
- GTK+ 3.10 / GLib 2.40 (ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
- libpwquality 1.2.3 (actually needed now, but) (ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
- libsqlite3 3.8.2 (ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)

these should all be included with your distribution

TODO
- ensure the item names are always unique in the Item Editor
	- same for Accounts
- use http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/extended_result_codes.html; ask them to document that the return (an error code that is now always SQLITE_OK) doesn't matter first
