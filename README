requirements:
- GTK+ 3.10 / GLib 2.40 (ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
- libpwquality 1.2.3 (actually needed now, but) (ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
- libsqlite3 3.8.2 (ships with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)

these should all be included with your distribution

TODO
- ensure the item names are always unique in the Item Editor
	- same for Accounts
- use http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/extended_result_codes.html; ask them to document that the return (an error code that is now always SQLITE_OK) doesn't matter first
- the description of password changes is /very/ misleading; it should be changed to say Request Change and that changes are actually applied when you click Save
- add a timer for orders by phone to predict how long it will take on particularly busy days?
