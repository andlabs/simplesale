- GtkStackSidebar is too new; change?
	- if keep, should we move the buttons and fuse them like in gtk3-widget-factory?
	- if keep, icons?
- either link, space, or move the o Login and Quit buttons
- lessen space between device editor drop-downs and Test Page buttons?
- searching the log
- make sure labels on the Other Settings and Add/Remove Money screens are left-aligned
- remove homogeneous from the Manager window GtkStack?
	- seems to work for making window not weirdly wide, but not too sure I like the effect without additional configuration or not...
- grow the Manager window initial height?
- is our GtkStack being made with any pages initially?
- make sure MockBackend's GtkListStores aren't being destroyed early
- switch from g_utf8_strlen() to just strlen()?





system TODOs
- split orders into multiple orders if the people decide to pay separately
