- GtkStackSidebar is too new; change?
	- if keep, should we move the buttons and fuse them like in gtk3-widget-factory?
	- if keep, icons?
- either link, space, or move the o Login and Quit buttons
- lessen space between device editor drop-downs and Test Page buttons?
- searching the log
- make sure labels on the Other Settings and Add/Remove Money screens are left-aligned
